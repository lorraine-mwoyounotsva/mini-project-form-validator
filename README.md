# Form Validator

## Overview

This is a simple and interactive registration form validator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps validate user input in real-time to ensure all fields are filled correctly before submission.

## Features

- Validates required fields (username, email, password, confirm password)
- Enforces length constraints for username and password
- Validates email format using regex
- Checks that both password fields match
- Provides instant visual feedback (green for success, red for errors)

## What I Learned

- How to use JavaScript to manipulate form elements dynamically
- Building custom validation functions from scratch
- Working with CSS transitions and form feedback
- Structuring clean, reusable, and accessible HTML forms
- Managing validation feedback with CSS classes

## How it Works

- Each field is checked when the form is submitted.
- If fields are empty or invalid, an error message is shown.
- If all fields are valid, an alert confirms registration.
- Visual cues (color-coded borders) show users which fields need attention.
